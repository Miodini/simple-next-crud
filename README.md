# CRUD REACT

## Introduction
A simple create, read, update, delete website made in React. Currently using json-server as a mock back-end server.
Created by a student in React :)

## How to install
- Ensure you have node.js installed.
- Clone this repo somewhere.
- Using your command line interface, go to [front](front/) and run `npm install` (or use your favorite node package manager).
- After everything is installed, run `npm start` to deploy the dev server (optionally, run `npm run build` and serve the resulting folder).
- Go to [back](back/) and run `npm install`.
- After everything is installed, run `npm start`.
- The front-end should now be running at `http://localhost:3000` and the back-end at `http://localhost:3001`.
